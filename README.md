List of all my hackathon project source code 

## Hand Gesture Controlled Wireless Communication System: 

Developed a human wearable device for computer gaming and general control of a computer via hand gestures. Based on a set of predefined gesture, the accelerometer on the hand recognizes these changes and send the data wirelessly through RF communication channel to the receiver on another computer. The receiver then acts according to the user command to do the following actions:

1) Open/close and minimize applications
2) Change PPT slides 
3) Play simple computer games by clicking on the screen
4) Moving the cursor on screen like a mouse

## Vehicle Collision Assistant: 

An end to end system which provides real-time alerts to a nearby hospital and highway patrol when accidents are detected in a vehicle. A real-time embedded system with many sensors is placed on a safe inner lock inside the bike which uses the force sensor, pressure sensor, GPS module, and GSM module to alert the nearby hospital with location and a send an SMS to family members with a detailed report containing the GPS coordinates and type of accident. Once the end-user receives the SMS, the mobile app reads the SMS and give the red pin spot of the accident on the google map. The mobile application contains additional features such as highway patrol, nearby hospital location and user reviews on road safety, etc. 

Implemented using:
- Arduino 
- GPS and GSM module
- Force and pressure sensor

## Smart compare of retails products 

A dynamic comparison tool that compares products, observing user actions in a web application. Consider going to a shoe shop, with so many options available user will easily get confused and get distracted by the employee's recommendation to buy old stock or one which does not suit you. Thus, the users can compare two or more products by bringing those shoeboxes to the nearby pods and scanning them using the barcode scanner one by one. Once scanned the user, we get a comparison page and users can easily visualize and buy the product with a single click on the screen. 

Implemented using:
- Node.js
- Python 
- Ajax
- Raspberry pi
